# AI Usage Log

## FDE tech assessment instructions

### Prompts and iterations

- Requested creation and commit of `FDE_Tech_Assessment_(T2).md`, then clarified repo state after deleting local and remote git history.
- Asked for a production-ready stack choice; selected Python, then requested a technical specification.
- Added a TDD requirement and asked for a Git workflow.
- Requested the technical specification in both plain and Markdown formats.

### How AI was used

- Generated a production-ready Python stack recommendation aligned with the assessment requirements.
- Produced a structured technical specification for the project, including TDD requirements.
- Suggested a practical Git workflow and conventional commit guidance.
- Summarized repository status and next steps after re-initializing git.

### Outcomes achieved

- Created `FDE_Tech_Assessment_(T2).md` in the project root and committed it as the initial commit.
- Established a clear technical specification and workflow guidance for the banking service assignment.

## Banking service technical specification and rules

### Summary of prompts and iterations

- Refine the technical specification and capture requirements in a new markup file.
- Create Cursor rules for TDD, JSON logging, SQLite safety, and Ubuntu 24.04.
- Build TDD milestone checkpoints and convert them to a checklist grouped by category.
- Draft architecture and implementation plan documents with DB schema and diagrams.
- Update architecture and plan for secure session management, refresh tokens, and audit logs.
- Stage and commit documentation changes with appropriate messages.

### How AI was used

- Structured and expanded the technical spec into concrete API, data model, and ops guidance.
- Authored project rules to enforce testing, logging, DB safety, and startup health checks.
- Organized milestone checkpoints into trackable phases and mapped them to TDD gates.
- Produced architecture and implementation plan docs including schema and flows.
- Assisted with clean, conventional commits for documentation deliverables.

### Things achieved

- Added `TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` with the refined spec.
- Added `.cursor/rules/banking.mdc` enforcing project rules.
- Added `MILESTONES.md` and linked it from `README.md`.
- Added `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with schema and diagrams.
- Updated architecture to include refresh token rotation and centralized audit logs.
