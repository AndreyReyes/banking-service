# Cursor Rules — Banking Service

## Must Follow
- Do not modify `FDE_Tech_Assessment_(T2).md`.
- Enforce TDD: write failing tests before implementation.
- Use structured JSON logging with `structlog`.
- Use safe SQLite patterns (transactions, WAL mode, busy timeout).
- Ensure compatibility with Ubuntu 24.04.
- Always check DB health on startup and fail fast if unhealthy.

## API & Data
- Keep API versioned under `/v1`.
- Use consistent error envelope and HTTP status codes.
- Store money in minor units (integers) to avoid float errors.
- Use UTC timestamps everywhere.
- Use Alembic migrations for schema changes.

## Security
- Never log or commit secrets.
- Hash passwords with bcrypt/argon2.
- Validate all inputs via Pydantic models.

## Testing
- Add unit tests for services and integration tests for endpoints.
- Maintain coverage and include new tests with each feature.

## Logging
- Include `request_id`, `method`, `path`, `status_code`, `duration_ms`.
- Log exceptions with stack traces and contextual fields.

## Database Safety
- Use explicit transactions for multi‑step operations.
- Use `SELECT 1` for health checks.
- Avoid raw SQL unless necessary and documented.

## Dev Workflow
- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`).
- Keep commits small and meaningful.
- Update docs when behavior or endpoints change.
